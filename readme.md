## My Review of this assignment



## My Pseudo Code 
MemoryGame object{
	matrix 3*4 (in random)
	number of wrong gusses
	timer
}
win -> popup overlay start new game
no more than 2 cards flipped
	
### Different Functionalities
- play game
- reset game
- game finished
- timer finished
- number of wrong gusses reached
- all cards open

### Things that should be in HTML
- header game name , timer , curr wrong attempts , start new game
- board 3*4


### Things that should be generated in js

fill board with random cards images
start timer

card.addEventListener



### memory board
it is two dimensional array boardSize\*boardSize
